# The Diversity We Breath: Community Diversity and Gas Leak Management

This repository contains the code and final datasets to replicate the empirical analysis in "The Diversity We Breath: Community Diversity and Gas Leak Management".

We encourage researchers to make use of the code and data in this repository, but we kindly ask to cite the paper in any publication as:

[SUGGESTED CITATION]

## Instruction
To reproduce the **final results**:
- Run scripts in the scripts/analysis directory in alphabetic order. The names of scripts refer to the table/figure they create, which are saved in the results directory.
- For Python scripts, make sure to set your working directory to the root of this repository. All paths are relative to the root, and the scripts should run smoothly.
- For Stata scripts, please change the global variable defined at the beginning of each code to the root of the directory in your system before running the scripts. All paths are relative to the root, and the scripts should run smoothly after this change.

To reproduce **data construction**:
- Run scrits/create_data/A_directoryStructure.py to create a local directory structure.
- Contact the corresponding author to obtain raw data and copy it into data/raw.
- Run scripts in the scripts/data_processing directory from the root directory.
- Note that to georeference leaks, you will need to provide the path to your Google API in the scripts/create_data/B-geocodeLeaks.py, line 25, where the local variable PATH_TO_KEY is defined. The structure of the file is quite simple, just one line where you replace [API_KEY] for your key: GOOGLE_GEOREF_API_KEY=[API_KEY].

## Software requirements
The data processing is run entirely on Python. The following packages are required:
- GeoPandas
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup
- Numpy
- SciPy

The scripts that run the final analysis are run in Python and Stata. For Python, the following packages are required
- GeoPandas
- Pandas

Please do not hessitate to contact should you find any difficulty running the scripts.
